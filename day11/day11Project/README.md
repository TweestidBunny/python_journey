# Day 11 Capstone Project - Blackjack

For the first capstone project in the course,
I'll be building a text based blackjack game.

It will have almsot everything a regular
blackjack game will have.

Initially 2 cards will be dealt to both the
user and the dealer, and one card from the dealer
will be covered.

The user will be able to hit or stand, and after
every action, a calculation will be made to see
whether the user has 'busted'.

After the user decides to stand, the dealer will
get a turn.

In the end, both of the hands will be compared,
and whichever is closest to 21 without going over
wins.
