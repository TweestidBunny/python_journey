# Day 10 Project - Calculator

This is just a text based calculator.

It will get the first number from the user,
then the operator, then the second number.

After the calculation is done, it will save
the result, so it can be reused if the user wants.

After the result is shown, the user will be given
the option to continue working with the current
number or starting a new calculation.
