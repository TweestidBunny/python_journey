# Day 5 Project - Password Generator

I will be creating a generic password generator
by randomly selecting how many of each type of
character the user wants, appending to a list, 
then randomizing and joining the resulting list.

It will ask the user for how many letters they want,
how many symbols, and how many numbers.

The generator will then pick a random letter as many
times as the user wants letters, same with numbers
and symbols.

It will then randomize(shuffle) all of the characters
used in the password, with a check to make sure
the very first character is a letter.
