# Day 4 Project - Rock Paper Scissors

Today I will create a console based
Rock Paper Scissors game, to be played
by the user and the computer.
Using a random number generator to pick for the
computer.

Then showing the ascii art for whichever selection
the player and computer chose.

Storing the ascii art within a list(not array!!),
the list index of the art will be the same as the
choice made by the player and user.
