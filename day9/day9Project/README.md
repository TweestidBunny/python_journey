# Day 9 Project - Silent Auction

This app is a 'Silent Auction'.
Simply meaning that users will get a turn entering
their name, and their bid. After they bid, the current
user will be asked if there area any more bidders.
If there are more bidders, the screen will be cleared,
and the next 'bidder' will be prompted to enter their
name, then their bid.

When all 'bidders' are finished, the highest bidder will
be revealed, along with their bid.
