# Day 3 Project - Choose Own Adventure

In todays end of day project, I'll be building a 
"Choose your own adventure" console game.

Simply put, you start with a welcome message explaining
"where you are", then it says what you see.
You then get to choose which "direction" you want to go.
E.G., left, right, up, etc...

In this exact project, we're looking for treasure at
the end of the journey. But there are possible pitfalls
on the way. Only by choosing the "correct" path, will
you find the treasure.
