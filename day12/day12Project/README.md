# Day 12 Project - Number Guessing Game

In todays project, I will be creating a number
guessing game.

A random number between 1 and 100(included) will
be set, then the user gets a number a chances
to guess the correct number.

If the guessed number is too high, the user will be
informed, same with if it's too low.

The user will then be shown how many chances they have
left, before losing.

If the user guesses correctly, they will be told so.

In this version of the project, there will be no 
"Play Again" option.
