# Day 7 Project - Hangman

This is a console based hangman game.
The same rules apply as always. You start with
a random word, which starts as all blanks.
You guess a letter. If that letter is in the word,
that letter is 'uncovered'. If you guess wrong,
the stick figure gets closer and closer to being
full, and you lose.

If you guess all of the letters correctly, and
uncover the entire word, you win.
