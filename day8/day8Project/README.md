# Day 8 Project - Caesar Cypher

This project is a console based Caesar Cypher
app.

In it, the user will have an option to 'encode'
or 'decode' a message, enter their message, and the
amount to shift the letters.

The program will then print out the resulting encode
or decode to the console.

After it's complete, the user will then have the
option to go again, to encode or decode something
else.
