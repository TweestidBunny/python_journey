# Python Journey

This is my journey to learn Python.
I am using the [100 Days Of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
course from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com).

In this repo, I will track my progress through all 100
days. I will save some of the daily practices, such as
a BMI calculator (console only) from day 2.
But I will mainly be saving the end of day projects, 
complete with a README for each one describing what
each project will contain.
