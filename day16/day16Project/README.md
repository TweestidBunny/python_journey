# Day 16 Project - Coffee Machine (OOP)

This is the same project at day 15, the coffee
machine. Only this time, it's done using OOP.

The files with the classes have already been set
up by the appbrewery team.

The purpose of this project is to get familiar with
creating objects using pre-defined classes, such as
if working with a team of others who set up the classes,
or using third party frameworks/libraries, such as
PrettyTable, tkInter, pygame, Turtle, etc.

The project requirements are the same, build a working
coffee maker, but instead of having global functions and
variables to do everything, all functionality is hidden
away inside of individual classes, all doing specific
jobs.
