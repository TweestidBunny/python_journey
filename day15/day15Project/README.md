# Day 15 Project - Coffee Machine (no classes)

This is a text based coffee machine.
In it, the user is prompted to select from one
of three coffee drinks.

If the user selects a valid option, they are then
prompted to enter a payment.

If the payment is sufficient, the drink is made, and
any change is given back.

It has the option to get a report, to see how many
resources are remaining and the amount of money
currently in the machine.

It also has an option to turn the machine off when
finished.
